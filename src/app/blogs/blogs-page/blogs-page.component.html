    <p class="text-left-blogs margin-details-blogs">
      As a <strong>BOOKMAKER</strong>, you will have to become familiar with your customers betting habits, how often
      they win and lose
      and where they like to place their action. The closer attention you pay to your business, the better it will
      perform and the more players will flock to you to place their action. However; if you fail to track this
      life-blood of your business, i.e. the data, then you will quickly find out that you are leaving money on the
      table.
    </p>

    <p class="text-left-blogs margin-details-blogs">
      Learning <strong>HOW TO BECOME A BOOKIE</strong> isn’t as hard as it seems, it’s the relentless dedication that
      you need to ensure
      your success that’s the hard part. Doing things, the old-fashioned way, tracking your local players and entering
      their action in a little black book only belongs in the movies. Nowadays, bookies use electronic systems and
      computers to run their business and manage their data.
    </p>

    <p class="text-left-blogs margin-details-blogs">
      This is where you may begin to feel resistance to the industry, electronic ledgers and internet systems may sound
      intimidating, we assure you they are not. The images of old gangster types from films, penciling in the action
      from their players into their ledgers is the stuff of Hollywood movies. Today, those bookies wouldn’t even make it
      through a good sports day. Using automated systems such as <strong>PAY PER HEAD SOFTWARE</strong>, available from
      Payperhead.net,
      can give your bookie business the solid foundations it needs to be successful.
    </p>

    <p class="text-left-blogs margin-details-blogs">Managing your data is the number one priority of any bookie.
      Learning how to become a bookie is all about
      managing and securing the gaming data from your players and tracking their habits as they play. Doing things
      manually is ineffective and can end up costing you lost bets and even lost players. Taking the action from a large
      number of players will seem next to impossible and this was one of the bookies most important functions.</p>
